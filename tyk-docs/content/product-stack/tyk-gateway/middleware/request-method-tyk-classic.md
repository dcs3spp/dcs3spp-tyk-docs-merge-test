Tyk's [request method transform]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/transform-traffic/request-method-transform" >}}) middleware is configured at the endpoint level, where it modifies the HTTP method used in the request to a configured value.

When working with Tyk Classic APIs the transformation is configured in the Tyk Classic API Definition. You can do this via the Tyk Dashboard API or in the API Designer.

If you're using the newer Tyk OAS APIs, then check out the [Tyk OAS]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/request-method-tyk-oas" >}}) page.

## Configuring a Request Method Transform in the Tyk Classic API Definition

To configure a transformation of the request method you must add a new `method_transforms` object to the `extended_paths` section of your API definition.

It has the following configuration:
- `path`: The path to match on
- `method`: The method to match on
- `to_method`: The new HTTP method to which the request should be transformed

All standard HTTP methods are supported: `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`.

For example:
```json
{
    "method_transforms": [
        {
            "path": "/status/200",
            "method": "GET",
            "to_method": "POST"
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example the Request Method Transform middleware has been configured for HTTP `GET` requests to the `/status/200` endpoint. Any request received to that endpoint will be modified to `POST /status/200`.

## Configuring a Request Method Transform in the API Designer

You can use the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard to configure the request method transform middleware for your Tyk Classic API by following these steps.

### Using the Dashboard

#### Step 1: Add an endpoint for the path and select the Method Transform plugin

From the **Endpoint Designer** add an endpoint that matches the path for which you want to perform the transformation. Select the **Method Transform** plugin.

#### Step 2: Configure the transform

Then select the HTTP method to which you wish to transform the request.

#### Step 3: Save the API

Use the *save* or *create* buttons to save the changes and make the transform middleware active.

Tyk's [request method transform]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/transform-traffic/request-method-transform" >}}) middleware is configured at the endpoint level, where it modifies the HTTP method used in the request to a configured value.

When working with Tyk OAS APIs the transformation is configured in the [Tyk OAS API Definition]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc#operation" >}}). You can do this via the Tyk Dashboard API or in the API Designer.

If you're using the legacy Tyk Classic APIs, then check out the [Tyk Classic]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/request-method-tyk-classic" >}}) page.

## Configuring the Request Method Transform in the Tyk OAS API Definition

The request method transform middleware (`transformRequestMethod`) can be added to the `operations` section of the Tyk OAS Extension (`x-tyk-api-gateway`) in your Tyk OAS API Definition for the appropriate `operationId` (as configured in the `paths` section of your OpenAPI Document). Endpoint `paths` entries (and the associated `operationId`) can contain wildcards in the form of any string bracketed by curly braces, for example `/status/{code}`. These wildcards are so they are human readable and do not translate to variable names. Under the hood, a wildcard translates to the “match everything” regex of: `(.*)`.

You only need to enable the middleware (set `enabled:true`) and then configure `toMethod` as the new HTTP method to which the request should be transformed. The design of the Tyk OAS API Definition takes advantage of the `operationId` defined in the OpenAPI Document that declares both the path and method for which the method should be transformed.

All standard HTTP methods are supported: `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`.

For example:
```json {hl_lines=["39-41"],linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "components": {},
    "info": {
        "title": "example-request-method",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "openapi": "3.0.3",
    "paths": {
        "/status/200": {
            "get": {
                "operationId": "status/200get",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": ""
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "x-tyk-api-gateway": {
        "info": {
            "name": "example-request-method",
            "state": {
                "active": true
            }
        },
        "upstream": {
            "url": "http://httpbin.org/"
        },
        "server": {
            "listenPath": {
                "value": "/example-request-method/",
                "strip": true
            }
        },
        "middleware": {
            "operations": {
                "status/200get": {
                    "transformRequestMethod": {
                        "enabled": true,
                        "toMethod": "POST"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example the Request Method Transform middleware has been configured for requests to the `GET /status/200` endpoint. Any request received to that endpoint will be modified to `POST /status/200`.

The configuration above is a complete and valid Tyk OAS API Definition that you can import into Tyk to try out the request method transform.

## Configuring the Request Method Transform in the API Designer

Adding the transform to your API endpoints is easy when using the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard, simply follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add an endpoint

From the **API Designer** add an endpoint that matches the path and method to which you want to apply the middleware.

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-no-endpoints.png" alt="Tyk OAS API Designer showing no endpoints created" >}}

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-add-endpoint.png" alt="Adding an endpoint to an API using the Tyk OAS API Designer" >}}

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-no-middleware.png" alt="Tyk OAS API Designer showing no middleware enabled on endpoint" >}}

#### Step 2: Select the Method Transform middleware

Select **ADD MIDDLEWARE** and choose the **Method Transform** middleware from the *Add Middleware* screen.

#### Step 3: Configure the middleware

Select the new HTTP method to which requests to this endpoint should be transformed

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-method-transform-config.png" alt="Selecting the new HTTP method for requests to the endpoint" >}}

Select **ADD MIDDLEWARE** to apply the change to the middleware configuration.

#### Step 4: Save the API

Select **SAVE API** to apply the changes to your API.

Tyk's [enforced timeout]({{< ref "planning-for-production/ensure-high-availability/enforced-timeouts" >}}) middleware is configured at the endpoint level, where it sets a limit on the response time from the upstream service. If the upstream takes too long to respond to a request, Tyk will terminate the request and return `504 Gateway Timeout` to the client.

When working with Tyk Classic APIs the enforced timeout is configured in the Tyk Classic API Definition. You can do this via the Tyk Dashboard API or in the API Designer.

If you're using the newer Tyk OAS APIs, then check out the [Tyk OAS]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/enforced-timeout-tyk-oas" >}}) page.

## Configuring an enforced timeout in the Tyk Classic API Definition

To configure an enforced timeout you must add a new `hard_timeouts` object to the `extended_paths` section of your API definition.

It has the following configuration:
- `path`: the endpoint path
- `method`: the endpoint HTTP method
- `timeout`: the duration of the upstream request timer

For example:
```json
{
    "hard_timeouts": [
        {
            "path": "/status/200",
            "method": "GET",
            "timeout": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example the enforced timeout has been configured to monitor requests to the `GET /status/200` endpoint. It will configure a timer that will expire (`timeout`) 3 seconds after the request is proxied to the upstream service.

If the upstream response is not received before the expiry of the timer, that request will be terminated and Tyk will return `504 Gateway Timeout` to the client.

## Configuring an enforced timeout in the API Designer

You can use the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard to configure the enforced timeout middleware for your Tyk Classic API by following these steps.

#### Step 1: Add an endpoint for the path and select the Enforced Timeout plugin

From the **Endpoint Designer** add an endpoint that matches the path for which you want to deploy the enforced timeout. Select the **Enforced timeout** plugin.

#### Step 2: Configure the timeout

Then enter the timeout to be enforced for the endpoint (in seconds):

#### Step 3: Save the API

Use the *save* or *create* buttons to save the changes and make the circuit breaker active.

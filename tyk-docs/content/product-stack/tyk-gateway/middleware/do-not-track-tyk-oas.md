The [Do-Not-Track]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/do-not-track-middleware" >}}) middleware provides the facility to disable generation of transaction records (which are used to track requests to your APIs). When working with Tyk OAS APIs, you can currently disable tracking only at the endpoint-level.

When working with Tyk OAS APIs the middleware is configured in the [Tyk OAS API Definition]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/oas/x-tyk-oas-doc#operation" >}}) either manually within the `.json` file or from the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard.

If you're using the legacy Tyk Classic APIs, then check out the [Tyk Classic]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/do-not-track-tyk-classic" >}}) page.

## Configuring the middleware in the Tyk OAS API Definition
The design of the Tyk OAS API Definition takes advantage of the `operationId` defined in the OpenAPI Document that declares both the path and method for which the middleware should be added. The `path` can contain wildcards in the form of any string bracketed by curly braces, for example `{user_id}`. These wildcards are so they are human readable and do not translate to variable names. Under the hood, a wildcard translates to the “match everything” regex of: `(.*)`.

The do-not-track middleware (`doNotTrackEndpoint`) can be added to the `operations` section of the Tyk OAS Extension (`x-tyk-api-gateway`) in your Tyk OAS API Definition for the appropriate `operationId` (as configured in the `paths` section of your OpenAPI Document).

The `doNotTrackEndpoint` object has the following configuration:
- `enabled`: enable the middleware for the endpoint

For example:
```json {hl_lines=["39-41"],linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "components": {},
    "info": {
        "title": "example-do-not-track",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "openapi": "3.0.3",
    "paths": {
        "/anything": {
            "get": {
                "operationId": "anythingget",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": ""
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "x-tyk-api-gateway": {
        "info": {
            "name": "example-do-not-track",
            "state": {
                "active": true
            }
        },
        "upstream": {
            "url": "http://httpbin.org/"
        },
        "server": {
            "listenPath": {
                "value": "/example-do-not-track/",
                "strip": true
            }
        },
        "middleware": {
            "operations": {
                "anythingget": {
                    "doNotTrackEndpoint": {
                        "enabled": true
                    }               
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example the do-not-track middleware has been configured for requests to the `GET /anything` endpoint. Any such calls will not generate transaction records from the Gateway and so will not appear in the analytics.

The configuration above is a complete and valid Tyk OAS API Definition that you can import into Tyk to try out the do-not-track middleware.

## Configuring the middleware in the API Designer
Adding do-not-track to your API endpoints is easy when using the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard, simply follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add an endpoint

From the **API Designer** add an endpoint that matches the path and method to which you want to apply the middleware.

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-add-endpoint.png" alt="Adding an endpoint to an API using the Tyk OAS API Designer" >}}

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-no-middleware.png" alt="Tyk OAS API Designer showing no middleware enabled on endpoint" >}}

#### Step 2: Select the Do Not Track Endpoint middleware

Select **ADD MIDDLEWARE** and choose the **Do Not Track Endpoint** middleware from the *Add Middleware* screen.

#### Step 3: Save the API

Select **SAVE API** to apply the changes to your API.

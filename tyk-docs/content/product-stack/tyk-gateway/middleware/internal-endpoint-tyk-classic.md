The [Internal Endpoint]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/internal-endpoint-middleware" >}}) middleware instructs Tyk Gateway not to process external requests to the endpoint (which is a combination of HTTP method and path). Internal requests from other APIs will be processed.

When working with Tyk Classic APIs, the middleware is configured in the Tyk Classic API Definition. You can do this via the Tyk Dashboard API or in the API Designer.

If you're using the newer Tyk OAS APIs, then check out the [Tyk OAS]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/internal-endpoint-tyk-oas" >}}) page.

## Configuring the middleware in the Tyk Classic API Definition

To enable the middleware you must add a new `internal` object to the `extended_paths` section of your API definition.

The `internal` object has the following configuration:
 - `path`: the path to match on
 - `method`: this method to match on

For example:
```.json  {linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "extended_paths": {
        "internal": [
            {
                "disabled": false,
                "path": "/status/200",
                "method": "GET"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example the internal endpoint middleware has been configured for HTTP `GET` requests to the `/status/200` endpoint. Any requests made to this endpoint that originate externally to Tyk will be rejected with `HTTP 403 Forbidden`. Conversely, the endpoint can be reached internally by another API at `tyk://<listen_path>/status/200`.

## Configuring the middleware in the API Designer

You can use the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard to configure the internal endpoint middleware for your Tyk Classic API by following these steps.

#### Step 1: Add an endpoint for the path and select the plugin
From the **Endpoint Designer** add an endpoint that matches the path for which you want to allow access. Select the **Internal** plugin.

#### Step 2: Save the API
Use the *save* or *create* buttons to save the changes and activate the middleware.
